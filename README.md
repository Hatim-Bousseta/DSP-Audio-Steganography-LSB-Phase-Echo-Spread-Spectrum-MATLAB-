# DSP-Audio-Steganography-LSB-Phase-Echo-Spread-Spectrum-MATLAB-
A complete academic project implementing and analyzing four classic audio steganography techniques in MATLAB: LSB, Phase Coding, Echo Hiding, and Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS). Includes encoding &amp; decoding .

This project includes full MATLAB implementations with deep explanation and analysis of each technique.
